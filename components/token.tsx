              A planned utility token on Robinhood Chain (chainId 4663) for premium research
              access. It is unlaunched: no sale, no price, no listing, no contract. It is also
              entirely separate from the vault — holding it would confer no claim on the vault,
              its assets or its record.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a Web3 experiment, not a fundraising or investment vehicle. Launchpad terms and
              legal status remain unverified open items pending review.
