If it matters to you, treat it as unresolved.\n\nWhat we can say is what the anonymity is *not* load-bearing for. Nothing here asks you to trust the people: the code is public and reproducible, the guardrails are enforced by contracts you can read and call rather than by a promise, the vault holds no third-party money, and access is gated precisely so that no one is depositing on the strength of a reputation nobody has established. Verified identity and a legal counterparty will be provided to an auditing firm under engagement.\n\nIf you are evaluating whether to trust this project, the honest ranking of what should worry you is: **no third-party audit first, no track record second, anonymity third.** The first two are the ones we would fix first, and are being worked on in that order.",

It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, partnered with, or reviewed by either company.\n\nBoth names appear throughout this documentation because the project is built on top of them, and describing what it does without naming them would be less honest, not more. Specifically: the desk connects to a Robinhood **Agentic** account through Robinhood's own MCP server; the vault is deployed to **Robinhood Chain**, a public chain anyone can deploy to; and the agent itself is Anthropic's **Claude**, running in Claude Code on your machine. Those are dependencies. None of them is a review, an approval, or a safety guarantee — no one at either company has looked at this code.\n\nThe practical consequence, stated plainly because it is the thing worth taking away: **any confidence you have in Robinhood or in Anthropic should not transfer to Sphynx.** The vault is unaudited and holds nothing; the guardrails are enforced by this project's contracts, not by Robinhood's. \"Robinhood\", \"Robinhood Chain\", \"Claude\" and \"Anthropic\" are the marks of their respective owners and are used here only to identify the platforms this project runs on.",

The on-chain vault + guardrails-as-code module in `onchain/` is **no longer testnet-only**: as of **2026-07-26 it is deployed to Robinhood Chain mainnet, chainId 4663**, against real periphery.

On 2026-07-26 the 2-of-3 Safe called `acceptOwnership()` on `RWAVault`, `ChainlinkOracleAdapter` and `SessionKeyExecutor` in one batch, `pendingOwner()` now reads zero on all three, and `GuardrailConfig` and `UniswapSwapAdapter` were Safe-owned from construction. So every owner-controlled contract in the stack is owned by the 2-of-3 Safe: changing a risk cap, a price feed, the deposit cap or a session grant takes two of three signatures, and the deploy key reverts with `OwnableUnauthorizedAccount` on all of them. **There is no timelock yet**: a change the Safe signs takes effect in one transaction.
