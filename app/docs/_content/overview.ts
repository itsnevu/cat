Neither does the gatekeeper.** Tokenized stocks made trading 24/7 and a swap one click; SPHYNX is the gatekeeper on both doors: on Robinhood you approve every order, and on-chain every swap must answer a vault that reverts any breach, behind a scoped, revocable, expiring key. Sphynx is an AI research desk in Claude Code with two surfaces and one rulebook. The headline surface is the brokerage desk: it connects to a **Robinhood Agentic** account over [MCP](/docs/mcp) and behaves like a small institutional desk — a team of specialist AI analysts screens your watchlist, debates each candidate, and hands you a one-click **preview card**. You approve; it places. It never places an order without your yes, and that isn't changing.",
