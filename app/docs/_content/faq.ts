Ownership is settled, every owner-controlled contract is owned by a **2-of-3 Safe multisig**, so no single hot key can move a risk cap, a feed or the deposit cap — but **there is no timelock yet**, a change the Safe signs takes effect in one transaction, and multisig custody is custody, not an audit.

The agent's remaining session budget is printed before and after every attempt, so **\"a refused order spends none of the budget\"** is something you check rather than take on trust. The script asserts its own outcome — exactly four refusals and one fill — and fails if that ever stops being true.\n\n**What it is not:** a track record. The periphery is mock, the depositor is the operator, the price never moves, and the attested return is zero because nothing was earned. It shows the *mechanism* working; it is not performance, not third-party money, and **not a substitute for an audit**. The recorded transcript and that boundary live in `onchain/evidence/full-cycle.md`.",

Its session key is scoped by **expiry, per-trade size, total spend budget, trade count, and a ticker allowlist**; the owner (the 2-of-3 Safe) grants and revokes sessions; and the vault itself **reverts any order that breaches the compiled caps** — a rejected order spends none of the session budget. What the scoping does **not** include: per-depositor limits. The caps govern one pooled book, and changing them takes two of three Safe signatures, with **no timelock yet**.",
